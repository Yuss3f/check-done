# Check Done - To-Do List Web Application

**Check Done** is a simple and fully functional **To-Do List Web Application** that allows users to add, delete, and mark tasks as complete. The project was built using basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and it utilizes the browser's localStorage to store tasks persistently.

## Features :sparkles:

- Add new tasks to the to-do list
- Mark tasks as completed by clicking on them
- Delete tasks from the list
- Tasks are saved in localStorage, so they persist even after refreshing the browser or reopening the app

## Tech Stack :computer:

- **HTML5** - Used to structure the web page
- **CSS3** - Used for styling the web app
- **JavaScript (ES6)** - Provides the core functionality for adding, deleting, and marking tasks as completed
- **localStorage** - Used to save the to-do list data locally in the browser

## File Structure :file_folder:

```plaintext
/Check_Done
│
├── /public
│   ├── index.html       # Main HTML file
│   ├── style.css        # Styling for the application
│   └── script.js        # JavaScript logic for the application
│
├── package.json         # Project metadata and dependencies (if any)
└── README.md            # This file
```
## How to Run the Project :white_check_mark:

To run the project locally, follow these steps:
1. **Clone the repository**
``` bash
git clone https://github.com/Yuss3f/Check_Done.git
```
2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
``` bash
cd Check_Done
```
3. **Open the project in a live server (optional):**
If you have a live server installed, you can run:
```bash
live-server public
```
This will automatically open the project in your browser at http://localhost:8080.

4. **Manually open the app:**

Alternatively, you can open the public/index.html file directly in your browser to view the app.

## How It Works :bar_chart:

1. Type a new task in the input field.
2. Click the "Add" button to add the task to the list.
3. Click on a task to mark it as completed.
4. Click the "Delete" button next to any task to remove it from the list.
5. All tasks are saved in localStorage and will remain available even after refreshing the page.

## Future Improvements :watch:

Some possible features that can be added to Check Down:

* User authentication for personalized to-do lists
* Integration with a database like Firebase or MongoDB to store tasks in the cloud
* Add categories or tags for tasks
* Add due dates and reminders for tasks
